# üåæ Seasonal Weather Forecasting & Agriculture Advisory System

A **Python CLI-based simulation project** for seasonal weather forecasting and agricultural advisory.
This system provides two roles: **Admin** and **Farmer**. Admins can manage forecasts, advisories, and farmer queries, while Farmers can access weather data, receive crop advisories, and request personalized guidance.

Data is stored in **JSON** with full **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** functionality.
